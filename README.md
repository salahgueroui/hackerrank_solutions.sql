# hackerrank_solutions.sql
A collection of my personal **SQL solutions** for challenges from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), organized by topic and difficulty.
## About
I created this repository to:
- Practice and improve my SQL skills.
- Keep all my HackerRank SQL solutions organized in one place.
- Share clean and well-structured SQL queries with others.
- ## 🧾 Notes
- Queries use **MySQL** syntax (e.g., `LIMIT`, `IFNULL`, `DATE_FORMAT`, window functions available in MySQL 8).
- If you’re using a different database (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), you might need small syntax tweaks.
